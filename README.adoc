= UnitsDB

== Purpose

This data repository is used in conjunction with UnitsML.

Sources include:

* https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/[BIPM SI Brochure]
* https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811[NIST SP 811]
* ISO 80000 series
* (in some cases, "Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures, Their SI Equivalences and Origins" by Fran√ßois Cardarelli, is consulted)

NOTE: Conversion factors here are not updated with the revised SI.

== Structure

This repository contains the following YAML files:

`dimensions.yaml`:: Contains the base dimensions and their symbols.

`prefixes.yaml`:: Contains the SI prefixes and their symbols.

`units.yaml`:: Contains the units and their symbols.

`unit_systems.yaml`:: Contains the unit systems and their symbols.

`quantities.yaml`:: Contains the quantities and their symbols.


== Notes on prefixes

Decimal prefixes are keyed by their power of 10, e.g. `NISTp10_1`

The prefix `NISTp10_0` is a placeholder for unity.

Binary prefixes are keyed by their power of 2, e.g. `NISTp2_10`

== Notes on dimensions

The following dimensions are identified by NIST but they are excluded from
`dimensions.yaml` since they are unused:
