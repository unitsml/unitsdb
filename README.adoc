= UnitsDB

== Purpose

This data repository is used in conjunction with UnitsML.

Sources include:

* https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/[BIPM SI Brochure]
* https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811[NIST SP 811]
* ISO 80000 series
* (in some cases, "Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures, Their SI Equivalences and Origins" by François Cardarelli, is consulted)

NOTE: Conversion factors here are not updated with the revised SI.

== Structure

This repository contains the following YAML files:

`dimensions.yaml`:: Contains the base dimensions and their symbols.

`prefixes.yaml`:: Contains the SI prefixes and their symbols.

`units.yaml`:: Contains the units and their symbols.

`unit_systems.yaml`:: Contains the unit systems and their symbols.

`quantities.yaml`:: Contains the quantities and their symbols.


== Versioning

=== Version Scheme

UnitsDB follows semantic versioning (https://semver.org/[SemVer]) using a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` structure:

`MAJOR`:: Incremented for incompatible changes that may require updates to consuming applications

`MINOR`:: Incremented for backwards-compatible additions or changes

`PATCH`:: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes


=== Version field

Each YAML file in the database contains a `schema_version` field at the top level:

[source,yaml]
----
schema_version: "2.0.0"
dimensions:
  # content follows
----

The version number is consistent across all files in a given release, ensuring
the database is treated as a cohesive unit.

=== Version changes

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Version level |Types of changes

|`MAJOR`
|
* Structural changes to the data model
* Removal of units, dimensions, or quantities
* Changes to identifier schemes
* Any other backwards-incompatible changes

|`MINOR`
|
* Addition of new units, dimensions, or quantities
* Addition of new properties to existing entities
* Other backwards-compatible enhancements

|`PATCH`
|
* Corrections to symbols, names, or other properties
* Fixes to references between entities
* Other backwards-compatible fixes

|===

=== Version usage

Applications consuming UnitsDB should:

. Check the `schema_version` field to ensure compatibility, ensure all files are
  consistent with the same version
. Handle version transitions appropriately based on the semantic versioning rules
. Document which version(s) of UnitsDB they support

== Content classes

=== Dimensions

==== General

A dimension object in `dimensions.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: dimension_id
    type: type_identifier
  short: short_name
  {dimension_name}:
    power: power_numerator
    symbol: ASCII representation
    symbols:
    - ascii: ASCII representation
      html: "HTML representation"
      id: dimension_symbol_id
      latex: "LaTeX representation"
      mathml: "MathML representation"
      unicode: "Unicode representation"
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd1
    type: nist
  length:
    power: 1
    symbol: L
    symbols:

      id: dim_L
      latex: "\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{L}}"
      mathml: "<mi mathvariant='sans-serif'>L</mi>"
      unicode: "\U0001D5AB"
  short: length
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd2
    type: nist
  mass:
    power: 1
    symbol: M
    symbols:
    - ascii: M
      html: "&#x1D5AC;"
      id: dim_M
      latex: "\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{M}}"
      mathml: "<mi mathvariant='sans-serif'>M</mi>"
      unicode: "\U0001D5AC"
  short: mass

==== Notes

The following dimensions are identified by NIST but they are excluded from
`dimensions.yaml` since they are unused:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:

    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless

- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd86
    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless

- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd81
    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless

=== Prefixes

==== General

A prefix object in `prefixes.yaml` typically has the following structure:

  names:
  - prefix_name
  power: power

    ascii: ASCII representation
    html: "HTML representation"
    latex: "LaTeX representation"
    unicode: "Unicode representation"
    mathml: "MathML representation"
----

For example:

[source,yaml]

    mathml: "<mi>da</mi>"
----

==== Notes

Decimal prefixes are identified by their power of 10, e.g. `NISTp10_1`

The prefix `NISTp10_0` is a placeholder for unity.

Binary prefixes are identified by their power of 2, e.g. `NISTp2_10`

== Contributing

=== General

When contributing to this repository, please follow these guidelines.

=== Proposing a new unit, dimension, or quantity

. Check if the unit already exists in the database.
. If it does not exist, create a new YAML file in the appropriate directory
   (e.g., `units.yaml`, `dimensions.yaml`, etc.).
. Follow the structure outlined in the "Content classes" section.
. Ensure that the new unit is properly referenced in the relevant files.
. Add a test case for the new unit in the appropriate test file.
. Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly.
. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes made.
. Include any relevant references or sources for the new unit.
. Ensure that the pull request is against the `main` branch of the repository.
. Wait for review and feedback from the repository maintainers.
. Address any comments or suggestions made during the review process.
. Once approved, the pull request will be merged into the main branch.

=== UnitsML validation

All YAML files must be validated against the UnitsML schema before submitting a
pull request.

To validate UnitsDB content using UnitsML Ruby:

[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Validate content using RSpec which uses UnitsML Ruby
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=scripts/Gemfile bundle exec rspec ../spec --format documentation
