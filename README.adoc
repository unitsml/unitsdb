* https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/[BIPM SI Brochure]
* https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811[NIST SP 811]
* ISO 80000 series
* (in some cases, "Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures, Their SI Equivalences and Origins" by François Cardarelli, is consulted)

NOTE: Conversion factors here are not updated with the revised SI.

== Structure

This repository contains the following YAML files:

`dimensions.yaml`:: Contains the base dimensions and their symbols.

`prefixes.yaml`:: Contains the SI prefixes and their symbols.

`scales.yaml`:: Contains the measurement scale types and their properties.

`units.yaml`:: Contains the units and their symbols, with English and French
names. French translations come from BIPM.

`unit_systems.yaml`:: Contains the unit systems and their symbols.

`quantities.yaml`:: Contains the quantities and their symbols, with English and
French names. French translations come from BIPM.


== Supported languages

The database currently supports the following languages:

* English (en): Primary language for all entries

* French (fr): Provided for units and quantities, sourced from the BIPM SI
Digital Framework


== Versioning

=== Version scheme

UnitsDB follows semantic versioning (https://semver.org/[SemVer]) using a
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` structure.

Where,

`MAJOR`:: Incremented for incompatible changes that may require updates to consuming applications

`MINOR`:: Incremented for backwards-compatible additions or changes

`PATCH`:: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes


=== Version field

Each YAML file in the database contains a `schema_version` field (string) at the
top level.

[source,yaml]
----
schema_version: "2.0.0"
dimensions:
  # content follows
----

The version number is consistent across all files in a given release, ensuring
the database is treated as a cohesive unit.

=== Version changes

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Version level |Types of changes

|`MAJOR`
|
* Structural changes to the data model
* Removal of units, dimensions, or quantities
* Changes to identifier schemes
* Any other backwards-incompatible changes

|`MINOR`
|
* Addition of new units, dimensions, or quantities
* Addition of new properties to existing entities
* Other backwards-compatible enhancements

|`PATCH`
|
* Corrections to symbols, names, or other properties
* Fixes to references between entities
* Other backwards-compatible fixes

|===

=== Version usage

Applications consuming UnitsDB should:

. Check the `schema_version` field to ensure compatibility, ensure all files are
  consistent with the same version
. Handle version transitions appropriately based on the semantic versioning rules
. Document which version(s) of UnitsDB they support

== Content classes

=== Dimensions

==== General

Dimensions represent the fundamental physical quantities that form the basis of
any measurement system. They are the abstract properties that define the nature
of a physical quantity, independent of any specific unit of measurement.

* The SI system defines seven base dimensions (length, mass, time, electric
current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity).

* A special dimensionless dimension is also defined, which has no physical
significance but is used in certain contexts.

* Derived dimensions are formed by combining base dimensions through
multiplication, division, or exponentiation. For example, velocity is a derived
dimension formed from length and time (L/T), and force is derived from mass
and acceleration (ML/T²).

A dimension object in `dimensions.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: dimension_id
    type: type_identifier
  short: short_name
  {dimension_name}:
    power: power_numerator
    symbol: ASCII representation
    symbols:
    - ascii: ASCII representation
      html: "HTML representation"
      id: dimension_symbol_id
      latex: "LaTeX representation"
      mathml: "MathML representation"
      unicode: "Unicode representation"
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd1
    type: nist
  length:
    power: 1
    symbol: L
    symbols:
    - ascii: L
      html: "&#x1D5AB;"
      id: dim_L
      latex: "\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{L}}"
      mathml: "<mi mathvariant='sans-serif'>L</mi>"
      unicode: "\U0001D5AB"
  short: length
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd2
    type: nist

      mathml: "<mi mathvariant='sans-serif'>M</mi>"
      unicode: "\U0001D5AC"
  short: mass
----

==== Notes

The following dimensions are identified by NIST but they are excluded from
`dimensions.yaml` since they are unused:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd87
    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless

- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd86
    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless

- identifiers:
  - id: NISTd81
    type: nist
  dimensionless: true
  short: dimensionless
----


=== Prefixes

==== General

Prefixes are modifiers that can be attached to units to indicate decimal
multiples or submultiples. They provide a concise way to express very large or
small quantities without resorting to scientific notation.

[example]
The prefix "kilo" (k) multiplies a unit by 1000, so 1 kilometer equals 1000
meters.

The SI system defines a set of standard prefixes included in UnitsDB.

A prefix object in `prefixes.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: prefix_id
    type: type_identifier
  base: base
  names:
  - prefix_name
  short: prefix_short_name
  power: power
  symbol:
    id: symbol_id
    ascii: ASCII representation
    html: "HTML representation"
    latex: "LaTeX representation"
    unicode: "Unicode representation"
    mathml: "MathML representation"
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTp10_2
    type: nist
  base: 10
  names:
  - hecto
  short: hecto
  power: 2
  symbol:
    latex: h
    unicode: h
    ascii: h
    html: h
    id: hecto
    mathml: "<mi>h</mi>"
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTp10_1
    type: nist
  base: 10
  names:
  - deka
  short: deka
  power: 1
  symbol:
    latex: da
    unicode: da
    ascii: da
    html: da
    id: deka
    mathml: "<mi>da</mi>"
----

==== Notes

Decimal prefixes are identified by their power of 10, e.g. `NISTp10_1`

The prefix `NISTp10_0` is a placeholder for unity.

Binary prefixes are identified by their power of 2, e.g. `NISTp2_10`


=== Quantities

==== General

Quantities are measurable properties of physical phenomena, objects, or
substances. They represent the attributes that can be measured and expressed
with numbers. Each quantity is associated with a specific dimension (or
combination of dimensions) and can be measured using various units.

The SI system categorizes quantities into two main types:

* Base quantities: The seven fundamental quantities from which all others are
derived (length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount
of substance, and luminous intensity)

* Derived quantities: Quantities formed by algebraic combinations of base
quantities (e.g., area, volume, velocity, force)

Each quantity has a unique identity and can be measured in specific units that
share the same dimension.

[example]
"length" is a quantity that can be measured in meters, feet, or kilometers.

A quantity can be combined with other quantities to form compound quantities,
such as velocity (length/time) or force (mass × acceleration).

A quantity object in `quantities.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: quantity_id
    type: type_identifier
  names:
  - names
  quantity_type: {base|derived}
  short: short_name
  unit_references:

    type: type_identifier
  references:

=== Units

==== General

Units are standardized quantities used to express measurements of physical
properties. They provide a reference scale for measuring quantities, allowing
values to be communicated uniformly. Each unit is associated with a specific
physical quantity and dimension, and has a defined relationship to other units
in the same dimension.

The SI system classifies units into several categories:

* Base units: The seven fundamental units corresponding to the base quantities
(meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela)

* Derived units: Units formed from combinations of base units (e.g., newton,
joule, pascal)

* Special named units: Derived units that have been given unique names for
convenience (e.g., newton for kg·m/s²)

* Units outside the SI: Non-SI units that are accepted for use with the SI
(e.g., minute, hour, degree)

Units can be combined with prefixes to express multiples or submultiples, and
can be combined algebraically (through multiplication and division) to form
compound units.

A unit object in `units.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: unit_id
    type: type_identifier
  quantity_references:
  - id: quantity_id
    type: type_identifier
  names:
  - names
  root: true|false
  short: unit_short_name
  symbols:
  - id: symbol_id

    mathml: "MathML representation"
    latex: "LaTeX representation"
    unicode: "Unicode representation"
  dimension_reference:
    id: dimension_id
    type: type_identifier
  unit_system_reference:
  - id: unit_system_id
    type: type_identifier
  # Optional fields for derived units:
  prefixed: true|false

  # Note: Use either root_units OR si_derived_bases, but not both together

  # Use root_units for composite units that include any non-SI or non-SI-derived units
  # root_units can also contain SI units
  root_units:
  - power: power_numerator
    unit_reference:
      id: unit_id
      type: type_identifier
    prefix_reference:
      id: prefix_id
      type: type_identifier

  # Use si_derived_bases only for composite units that use exclusively SI base units
  si_derived_bases:
  - power: power_numerator
    unit_reference:
      id: unit_id
      type: type_identifier
    prefix_reference:
      id: prefix_id
      type: type_identifier
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: NISTu5
    type: nist
  quantity_references:
  - id: NISTq5
    type: nist
  names:

=== Scales

==== General

Scales define the mathematical properties of measurement systems and how values
relate to each other. They specify important characteristics like whether a
scale has a true zero point, whether equal intervals represent equal
differences, or whether the scale uses logarithmic relationships.

Understanding the scale type is crucial for proper interpretation of
measurements and for determining what mathematical operations can legitimately
be performed on the values.

[example]
On a ratio scale (like length), you can say that 10 meters is twice as long as 5
meters. On an interval scale (like Celsius temperature), 20°C is not "twice as
hot" as 10°C.

UnitsDB defines several scale types including continuous ratio scales,
continuous interval scales, logarithmic scales, and discrete scales, each with
specific properties that determine how measurements should be interpreted and
what mathematical operations are valid.

A scale object in `scales.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: scale_id
    type: type_identifier
  names:
  - scale_name
  short: short_name
  description:
  - description of scale type
  properties:
    continuous: true|false
    ordered: true|false
    logarithmic: true|false
    interval: true|false
    ratio: true|false
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- identifiers:
  - id: continuous_ratio
    type: unitsml
  names:
  - continuous ratio scale
  short: continuous_ratio
  description:
  - A measurement scale with continuous values and a true zero point, allowing for ratio comparisons
  properties:
    continuous: true
    ordered: true
    logarithmic: false
    interval: true
    ratio: true
- identifiers:
  - id: logarithmic_ratio
    type: unitsml
  names:
  - logarithmic ratio scale
  short: logarithmic_ratio
  description:
  - A scale where equal ratios appear as equal intervals, with a zero point representing a reference value
  properties:
    continuous: true
    ordered: true
    logarithmic: true
    interval: true
    ratio: true
----

Units refer to scales using a `scale_reference` object:

[source,yaml]
----
scale_reference:
  id: scale_id
  type: type_identifier
----

==== Notes

The following scale types are currently defined:

`continuous_ratio`:: A measurement scale with continuous values and a true zero
point (most physical quantities)

`continuous_interval`:: A measurement scale with continuous values but an
arbitrary zero point (e.g., temperature in °C)

`logarithmic_ratio`:: A logarithmic scale where equal ratios appear as equal
intervals (e.g., decibels)

`logarithmic_field`:: A logarithmic scale used for field quantities that uses
natural logarithms (e.g., neper)

`discrete`:: A scale consisting of discrete, countable values (e.g., bits)


== Unit systems

=== General

Unit systems are coherent collections of units that are used together to express
measurements in a consistent way. Each unit system has its own set of base units
and derived units, organized according to specific principles.

The most widely used unit system is the International System of Units (SI), but
the database also includes information about other unit systems and their
relationships to SI.

Unit systems help provide context for units, indicating whether they are part of
the official SI system, acceptable for use with SI (like minutes or degrees), or
belong to entirely different measurement frameworks (like imperial units). This
context is important for interoperability and conversion between different
measurement standards.

In the UnitsDB, units are associated with their respective unit systems through
references, allowing applications to identify which units belong to which
systems and to determine compatibility between measurements expressed in
different systems.

A unit system object in `unit_systems.yaml` typically has the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
- acceptable: {true|false} # whether the unit system is SI acceptable
  short: short_name
  identifiers:
  - id: unit_system_id
    type: type_identifier
  name: unit_system_name
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- acceptable: true
  short: si-compatible
  identifiers:
  - id: SI_compatible
    type: nist
  name: Units compatible with SI
- acceptable: true
  short: si-base
  identifiers:
  - id: SI_base
    type: nist
  name: SI base units
----

=== Notes

The following unit systems are currently defined:

`si-base`:: Contains the seven SI base units (meter, kilogram, second, ampere,
kelvin, mole, and candela). These form the foundation of the SI system.

`si-derived-special`:: Contains SI-derived units with special names and symbols
(e.g., newton, pascal, joule). These units are derived from base units but have
been given unique names for convenience.

`si-derived-nonspecial`:: Contains SI-derived units that use combinations of
base unit symbols without special names (e.g., m/s, kg/m³).

`si-compatible`:: Contains all units that are compatible with the SI system,
including base units, derived units, and accepted non-SI units.

`nonsi-acceptable`:: Contains non-SI units that are accepted for use with the SI
system based on the BIPM SI Brochure (e.g., minute, hour, degree).

`nonsi-unacceptable`:: Contains non-SI units that are not acceptable for use
with the SI system (e.g., deprecated or obsolete units).

`nonsi-nist-acceptable`:: Contains non-SI units that are acceptable according to
NIST SP 811 but may not be officially accepted by BIPM (e.g., certain customary
or traditional units).


In UnitsDB, a unit can belong to multiple unit systems. This classification
helps applications determine the appropriate use contexts for each unit.

[example]
A unit might be categorized as both `nonsi-unacceptable` (meaning it is not
acceptable for SI usage) but also as `nonsi-nist-acceptable` (meaning NIST SP
811 considers it acceptable in certain contexts).

When using unit systems in applications, the `acceptable` property can be used
as a quick filter for SI-compliant units, while more specific categorization can
be achieved using the individual unit system references.
